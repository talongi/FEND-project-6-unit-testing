**FEND P6 Feed Reader Testing**

This project required writing unit tests for an existing feed reader app. Tests were written to test the following functions:

1. The collection of feeds was retrived
2. The feeds in the collection were not empty and named
3. The navigation menu was hidden by default
4. Clicking the menu icon shows and hides the feed list
5. Tests an asynchronous function that load the feed data loads content correctly
6. Tests that new feed content is loaded when the loadFeed function is called with a new feed ID.

**Steps to run**
